#*********************************** Scenario: Creating Local Yum Repository *****************************************************************

The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. 
For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. 
This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named localyum and make sure to set Repository ID to localyum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package wget from this newly created repo.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************
Solution:

1. At first login on Backup server  & Switch to  root user
ssh clint@stbkp01 

2. Run the Below command to   check is there  already any yum repository is available    
yum repolist

3. Since there is no repo you need to create local repo  as per the task
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localyum.repo

[localyum]

name = localyum

baseurl = file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/

enabled = 1

gpgcheck = 0

4. After the file is saved, check to create repo listed 
yum repolist

5. As per the task install package (wget)
yum install wget

6. Validate the task 
yum list wget
